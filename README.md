# Experimental project: chatbot demonstration


Chatbot demonstration with BERT

Enclosed is a demonstration of a chatbot that answers question about a given piece of text. The model receives a question in English regarding text content and is required to mark the beginning and end of the answer in the text.

I trained Googleâ€™s neural network-based language model, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), on a piece of text about crossfit, and the model can answer question about what is included in the text.
